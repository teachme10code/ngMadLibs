# ngMadLibs

Requirements

You will need to write code that implements the two sketches you've been provided above. To reiterate:

On page load, the user should be presented with a UI like the first sketch above.
When they click "Generate My Mad Lib," the app should validate that the user has supplied a value for each of the text inputs. If the user is missing an input, the app should provide feedback about this. (It's up to you to define what that content is and how and where it should appear.)
All inputs are required.
Validate the huge number field to ensure the user has input a number.
If submitted form passes validation, the first view should be hidden, and the user should see the second view, with the word values they plugged in displayed in the appropriate locations.
At the bottom of the Mad Lib display interface, there should be a reset button that the user can click to start over. Without refreshing the page, this button should take the user back to the first view, and zero out the word values.
Keeping with the process you followed with your last refactor, you should create a new feature branch from master on which you'll do this refactor.

When you have completed the assignment, merge back into master, and push up to Github.com. Also, you should then merge your updated master branch in to your gh-pages branch, and push this up to Github.com. Share a link to your repo and to the gh-page with your mentor and with the community for feedback.

# ngMadLibs

Requirements

Take your existing Mad Libs app, and create a new branch where you reimplement it using one controller.
The end product should look and feel exactly the same as the original.
When you have completed the assignment, push this branch up to GitHub and share a link to it with your mentor.
Remember, you'll need to create an external JavaScript file that creates a module for this app and that adds a controller to that module. You'll need to link to this file in your HTML template.
In turn, you'll need to use ng-app to link to your module to your HTML. You'll also need to use ng-controller to give your controller control over the relevant part of the DOM.
When you've completed this assignment, you should merge your feature branch back into master, and push your changes up to GitHub.
